/* fork(); problem.
 *
 * On AmigaOS, ixemul.library provides fork(), but only as a stub.
 * This means that we can't use it even though configure finds it.
 * We can't run it to test it because that would mean that we would
 * lose all support for cross-compiling.   Blech.  We hack configure.in
 * to also check for the __amigaos__ proprocessor macro...
