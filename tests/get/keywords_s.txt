This file contains all the %-keywords so that we can make sure
that sccs-get substitutes them all correctly.

In the descriptive comments, I use "$" for "%" so that those
keywords that expand into the value of other keywords, like 
$A$ have useful descriptions.

$A$ Expands to $Z$$Y$ $M$ $I$$Z$
_A_ %A%
    %Z%%Y% %M% %I%%Z%

$B$ expands to the SID branch component.
_B_ %B%

$C$ is the current line number.  We have two in a row here, just for fun.
_C_ %C%
_C_ %C%

$D$ is the current date (year/month/day, the only sensible order).
Only two digits for the year.  Oops.
_D_ %D%

$E$: date of the newest delta.
_E_ %E%

$F$: name of the s.file.
_F_ %F%

$G$: Like $E$, but in the US order, mm/dd/yy.
_G_ %G%

$I$: SID of the retrieved version ($R$.$L$.$B$.$S$)
_I_ %I%
%R%.%L%.%B%.%S%

$L$: level of the SID.
_L_ %L%

$M$: module name (value of m flag or base name fo the s.file if the 
m flag is not set).
_M_ %M%

$P$: Full name of the s.file (not easy to test).
_P_ %P%

$Q$: value of the q flag.
_Q_ %Q%

$R$: release component of SID
_R_ %R%

$S$: sequence component of SID
_S_ %S%

$U$: time the newest applied delta was created
_U_ %U%

$W$: "what": stands for $Z$ $M$ $I$ (useful for sccs-what)
_W_ %W%
    %Z% %M% %I%

$Y$: value of the t flag (!)
_Y_ %Y%

$Z$: expands to @(#) the marker string for sccs-what.
_Z_ %Z%


-------------------
STOP HERE
-------------------

The following entries are very hard to test automatically.

$H$: Current date, US order.
%H% : not easily testable; best to use separate test script.

$T$: current time (difficult to test....)
%T%
